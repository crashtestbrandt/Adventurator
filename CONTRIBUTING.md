# Contributing to Adventurator

Welcome! 🎲
This guide will walk you through how to safely collaborate on this repository using Git and GitHub.

---

## 1. Getting Started

1. **Install Git**

   * [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don’t already have it.
   * On macOS/Linux, you can also use Homebrew or your package manager.

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crashtestbrandt/Adventurator.git
   cd Adventurator
   ```

3. **Set your Git identity** (only once on your machine):

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   ```

---

## 2. Branching Workflow

We use a **feature-branch workflow**:

* `main` → always stable, deployable
* Work happens on branches (`feature/...`, `bugfix/...`, `docs/...`)

### Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main   # make sure you’re up to date
git checkout -b feature/short-description
```

Examples:

* `feature/add-sheet-crud`
* `bugfix/fix-dice-parser`
* `docs/update-readme`

---

## 3. Making Changes

1. **Edit files** in `src/Adventurator/` or other folders.

2. **Check your changes locally**:

   * Run the tests:

     ```bash
     make test
     ```
   * Run the linter:

     ```bash
     make lint
     ```
   * Start the app locally:

     ```bash
     make run
     ```

3. **Stage and commit**

   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "Short, clear message about what you did"
   ```

> **Tip:** Keep commits small and focused. Use present tense, e.g., `"add transcript model"`.

---

## 4. Keeping Your Branch Updated

While working, keep your branch synced with `main`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-branch
git merge main
```

If there are conflicts, Git will mark them—fix manually, then:

```bash
git add <fixed files>
git commit
```

---

## 5. Pushing & Pull Requests (PRs)

1. **Push your branch**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-branch
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request**

   * Go to the repo on GitHub
   * Click **“Compare & pull request”**
   * Fill in the template:

     * What problem you solved
     * What changes you made
     * How to test it

3. **Get a review**

   * Another team member reviews and approves.
   * Make changes if requested, then push again:

     ```bash
     git add <files>
     git commit -m "address review comments"
     git push
     ```

4. **Merge**

   * Once approved and checks pass, **Squash & Merge** into `main`.

---

## 6. Best Practices

* **One branch = one task.** Don’t mix unrelated changes.
* **Write meaningful commit messages.**
* **Run tests and lint before pushing.**
* **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens).
* **Ask questions early**—better to clarify than guess.

## 7. Common Commands Cheat Sheet

| Task                      | Command                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Clone repo                | `git clone <url>`                      |
| New branch                | `git checkout -b feature/thing`        |
| Switch branch             | `git checkout branch-name`             |
| See status                | `git status`                           |
| Stage file                | `git add file.py`                      |
| Commit staged changes     | `git commit -m "message"`              |
| Pull latest main          | `git pull origin main`                 |
| Merge main into branch    | `git merge main`                       |
| Push branch to GitHub     | `git push -u origin feature/thing`     |
| View log (recent commits) | `git log --oneline --graph --decorate` |

## 8. Troubleshooting

* **“I accidentally committed to main”**

  * Make a branch from main, reset main:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/fix-branch
    git push -u origin feature/fix-branch
    ```

    Then restore `main` with:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git reset --hard origin/main
    ```

* **Merge conflicts**

  * Open the conflicted file, look for `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>`, fix manually, then:

    ```bash
    git add file.py
    git commit
    ```

* **Forgot to pull before pushing**

  * Run:

    ```bash
    git pull --rebase origin main
    git push
    ```
